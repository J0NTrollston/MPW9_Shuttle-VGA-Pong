2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Pong/datapath/temp/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Pong/datapath/temp/ball_center_x_proc[9]_i_4/O, cell Pong/datapath/temp/ball_center_x_proc[9]_i_4. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT Pong/datapath/temp/ball_center_x_proc[9]_i_4 is driving clock pin of 20 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[0], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[1], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[2], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[3], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[4], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[5], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[6], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[7], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[8], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[9], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_y_proc_reg[0], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_y_proc_reg[1], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_y_proc_reg[2], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_y_proc_reg[3], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_y_proc_reg[4] (the first 15 of 20 listed)
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port bidir[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port bidir[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#3 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port bidir[2] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#4 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port bidir[3] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#5 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port bidir[4] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#6 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port bidir[5] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
