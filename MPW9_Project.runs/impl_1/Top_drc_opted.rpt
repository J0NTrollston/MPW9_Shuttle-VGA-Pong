PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT Pong/datapath/temp/ball_center_x_proc[9]_i_4 is driving clock pin of 20 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[0], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[1], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[2], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[3], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[4], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[5], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[6], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[7], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[8], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_x_proc_reg[9], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_y_proc_reg[0], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_y_proc_reg[1], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_y_proc_reg[2], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_y_proc_reg[3], Pong/datapath/ballFunction/ball_center_y_proc_reg[4] (the first 15 of 20 listed)
Related violations: <none>
